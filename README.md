Implementation of A* Algorithm in Python (with GUI)

The code utilizes Python's Pygame library to display graphics on screen.\
If you haven't already, make sure to [download pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

The program uses a custom icon sourced from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/robot).

This project was completed as a partial requirement for the course Introdução à Robótica\
(Introduction to Robotics), under the supervision of Teacher Areolino Neto, Ph.D.
